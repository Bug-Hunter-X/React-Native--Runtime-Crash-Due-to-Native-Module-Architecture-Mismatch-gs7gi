# React Native Native Module Architecture Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in React Native development: native module architecture mismatches.  The issue arises when the architecture of your built native modules (e.g., arm64, x86) doesn't align with the architecture of the device you're running the app on.  This frequently leads to cryptic runtime crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Problem
The example showcases how a simple interaction with a native module can fail silently if there's an architecture incompatibility. The provided `bug.js` file attempts to use a native module that might not be compiled for the target architecture.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to address this by ensuring you build your native modules for all relevant architectures (arm64, x86, etc.) using the correct build configurations and tools.
