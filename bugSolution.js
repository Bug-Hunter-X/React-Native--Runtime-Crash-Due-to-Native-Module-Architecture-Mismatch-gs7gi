To resolve this, you need to ensure that your native modules are built to support the architectures of your target devices.

1. **Identify Target Architectures:** Determine which architectures your app needs to support (arm64, x86, x86_64). This depends on your target devices and simulators.
2. **Rebuild Native Modules:** Rebuild your native modules (typically using tools like `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`) to include support for all necessary architectures. This involves specifying the correct architectures during the build process. Consult the documentation of your specific native modules or libraries for the exact build instructions.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:**  After rebuilding the native modules, do a clean build of your entire React Native project. This ensures that the old, incompatible native modules are removed from the build.
4. **Check Build Settings:** Verify that your build settings (in your Android or iOS project) correctly configure the architectures. For Android, the `build.gradle` files play a crucial role. For iOS, check your Xcode project settings.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js - Correctly handling native modules
// This assumes your native module is correctly built for all target architectures
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;

if(MyNativeModule){
  MyNativeModule.someNativeFunction().then(result => {
    console.log('Native module result:', result);
  }).catch(error => {
    console.error('Error from native module:', error);
  });
} else {
  console.warn('Native Module not available')
}
```
