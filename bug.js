This error occurs when using a third-party library in React Native that has native modules.  The error message itself might be vague, but the root cause usually lies in a mismatch between the native module's architecture and the device's architecture. For instance, you might have built your native modules for an arm64 architecture, but your testing device is running on an x86 architecture. This will cause a runtime failure.

```javascript
//Example code that might cause the issue
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;

MyNativeModule.someNativeFunction().then(result => {
  console.log(result);
});
```
